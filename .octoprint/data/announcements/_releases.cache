        <title>New release: 1.2.15</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>Late on the 28th it sadly came to my attention that some users were
experiencing severe problems with their printer communication after
upgrading to the 1.2.14 release just published earlier that day. I immediately 
stopped the roll out of 1.2.14 and went to investigate.</p>

        <title>New release: 1.2.10</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            This should have been released way faster after 1.2.9, since it fixes two bugs introduced by this release, but a nasty flu that&#39;s making the rounds in Germany got in the way of this. While this time we have mostly fixes of bugs and little annoyances, at least a hand full of minor improvements also made it into this release:<br />

          <![CDATA[
            The most important thing right at the beginning: <b>If you are currently running version 1.2.7 you&#39;ll need to install the &quot;Updatefix 1.2.7&quot; plugin from the plugin repository before you can update your OctoPrint installation.</b><br />

        <title>New release: 1.2.6</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <i>Whoa, another one?</i> Yup. I forgot to pin the version of a library OctoPrint now depends on since 1.2.5. A new version of that library was released today which apparently has a bug that causes the <i>install</i> of OctoPrint to crash when it tries to pull in that new library version (&quot;pip install .&quot; works, &quot;python setup.py install&quot; does not). If you tried to update today and ran into errors, read further below on how to solve this manually.<br />
